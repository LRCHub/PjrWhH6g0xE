```
What's my name
(blowing back on this marry jane I'm analyzin the game)
And the game done chose me
(to bring pain to pussy niggaz and pussy hoes, its one in the same)
Ever since you told me
(there's only room for 2, I've been making less room for you)
Not only god could hold me
(hug my, love me, judge me, the only man that help is above me, holla)
I met so many men its like they're all the same
My appetite for loving is now my hunger pain
And when I'm feeing sexy who's gonna comfort me?
My only problem is their insecurity
(tired of being alone) yeah yeah
(arguing on the phone) yeah yeah
(telling all you're friends)yeah yeah
(you'll never understand)my love
'Cause I'm real(the way you walk the way you move the way you talk)
'Cause I'm real(the way you stare the way you look you're style you're hair)
'Cause I'm real(the way you smile the way you smell it drives me wild)
'Cause I'm real and I can't go on without you
Girl, I've been thinkin' bout this relationship
And I want to know is this as good as it gets
'Cause we've been through the worst times and the best times
But it was our time, even if it was part-time
My baby lookin' at me, smilin' at me, laughin' like we wasn't happy
But not knowin', ever growin' and we're gettin' married
Hard lovin' and straight thuggin'
Bitch, I ain't doin' this for nuttin'
I'm here to get it poppin', hoppin, let's ride up in the Benz
Hair blowin' in the wind, sun glistenin' off my skin, hey
I'm nasty, heh, you know me
But you still don't mess with your baby
'Cause I'm real(the way you walk the way you move the way you talk)
'Cause I'm real(the way you stare the way you look you're style you're hair)
'Cause I'm real(the way you smile the way you smell it drives me wild)
'Cause I'm real and I can't go on without you
Now people loving me and hating me treating me ungratefully
But not knowin' that they ain't making or breaking me
My life I live it to the limit and I love it
Now I can breath again baby now I can breath again
Now people screaming what's the deal with me and so and so
I tell the bitches mind ya biz but they don't hear me though
My life I live it to the limit and I love it
Now I can breath again baby now I can breath again
(tired of being alone) yeah yeah
(arguing on the phone) yeah yeah
(telling all you're friends)yeah yeah
(nigga don't understand)my love
'Cause I'm real(the way you walk the way you move the way you talk)
'Cause I'm real(the way you stare the way you look you're style you're hair)
'Cause I'm real(the way you smile the way you smell it drives me wild)
'Cause I'm real and I can't go on without you,and I can't go on without you
