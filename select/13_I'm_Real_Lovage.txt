What's my motherfuckin' name?
To bring pain to pussy niggaz and pussy hoes, it's one in the same

I met so many men and
It's like their all the same
My appetite for lovin'
Is now my hunger pain

Tired of bein' alone
Yeah, yeah
Sick of arguin on the phone
Yeah, yeah
Are you tellin' all your friends
Yeah, yeah
That your nigga don't understand
My love

Cause I'm real
The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair
Cause I'm real
The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you

Hard lovin' and straight thuggin'
Bitch, I ain't doin' this shit for nuttin'
I'm here to get it poppin', hoppin, let's ride up in the Benz
Hair blowin' in the wind, sun glistenin' off my skin

Now people lovin' me and hatin' me, treatin' me ungratefully
But not knowin' that they ain't makin' me or breakin' me
My life I live it to the limit and I love it
Now I can breathe again, baby, now I can breathe again

Tired of bein' alone
Yeah, yeah
Sick of arguin on the phone
Yeah, yeah
Are you tellin' all your friends
Yeah, yeah
That your nigga don't understand
My love

Cause I'm real
The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair
Cause I'm real
The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you
