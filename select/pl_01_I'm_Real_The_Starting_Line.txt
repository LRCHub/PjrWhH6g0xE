What's my name,
R-U-L-E,
Blowing back on mary jane,
And analyzin the game,
The game done chose me,
To bring the words I can't say,
it's one in the same,
Ever since you told me,
Theres only room for two, I'll
be makin less room for you,
Only God can hold me,
Judge me, the only man that
help is above me, holla,
I met so many men and,
It's like their all the same,
My appetite for lovin,
Is now my hunger pain,
And when I'm feelin sexy,
Who's gonna comfort me?
My only problem is,
Their insecurities,
Tired being alone... yeah, yeah
Sick of arguin on the phone...
yeah, yeah
Tellin all your friends...
yeah, yeah
But you men don't understand...
my love
Cause I'm real,
(the way you walk, the way you
move, the way you talk)
Cause I'm real,
(the way you stare, the way you
look, style your hair)
Cause I'm real,
(the way you smile, the way you
smell, it drives me wild)
Cause I'm real,
And I cant go on without you,
Now I've been thinkin bout this
relationship, and I wanna know,
Is this as good as it gets,
Cause we've been through the
worst times,
And the best times,
But it was our time,
Even if it was part time,
Now they be lookin at me,
smilin at me,
Laughin like we wasn't happy,
But not knowin, that we're
growin, and we're gettin
married,
Hard lovin, straight thuggin,
Bitch i ain't doin this for
nothing,
Hoppin, poppin,
Lets ride up in the benz,
Hair blowin in the wind,
Sun glistenin off my skin, hey!
And im nasty, and you know me,
So you don't mess with your
baby,
Cause I'm real,
(the way you walk, the way you
move, the way you talk)
Cause I'm real,
(the way you stare, the way you
look, style your hair)
Cause I'm real,
(the way you smile, the way you
smell, it drives me wild)
cause I'm real,
And I can't go on without you,
Now people loving me and hating
me and treating me ungratefully,
But not knowin' that they ain't
makin or breakin me,
My life I live it to the limit
and I love it,
Now I can breath again, baby I
can breath again,
Now people screaming what's the
deal with you and so and so,
I tell them bitches mind your
biz but they don't hear me
though,
I live my life to the limit and
I love it,
Now I can breath again, baby I
can breath again,
Tired being alone... yeah, yeah
Sick of arguin on the phone...
yeah, yeah
Tellin all your friends...
yeah, yeah
But you men dont understand...
my love
Cause I'm real,
(the way you walk, the way you
move, the way you talk)
Cause I'm real,
(the way you stare, the way you
look, your style, your hair)
Cause I'm real,
(the way you smile, the way you
smell, it drives me wild)
Cause I'm real,
And i cant go on without you,
And i cant go on without you...
